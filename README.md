cglcube
=======
New version of my glcube written in C. It is far from being done. Unlike [glcube](https://github.com/TheNiceGuy/glcube), there is no rotation, but most of the logic that is done should be better/more efficient.

Commands
--------
    :set power <int>
    :set color <name> <int> <int> <int>
    :set resolution <int> <int>
    :quit
